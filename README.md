## Summary

The main goal of the project is to design and build a single-phase low-power transformer, a crucial device in managing and manipulating electrical energy. The transformer has two key functions: the first is to adjust the electrical voltage level—either to increase the voltage for efficient transmission over long distances or to decrease it for specific uses, such as powering a phone. The second function is to provide galvanic isolation between the primary (input) and secondary (output) circuits, ensuring user protection against electric shocks.

The transformer offers significant advantages due to its simple design, which provides high reliability and minimal electromagnetic emissions—an essential aspect compared to other power supplies that may generate disruptive electromagnetic interference.

Structurally, the low-power transformer consists of the following main components:

- **Electro-insulating case**: Provides protection against direct contact with electrical components and prevents accidents.
- **Windings**: Consist of conductor wire coils divided into primary and secondary windings, each with a specific role in the energy transformation process.
- **Ferromagnetic core**: The central element of the transformer through which the magnetic flux generated by the primary coil is efficiently transferred to the secondary coil.
- **Core clamping and transformer fastening system**: Ensures the structural stability of the transformer and maintains components in the correct position.

The operation of the transformer is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. The electric current passing through the primary coil generates a magnetic field. Due to the transformer's configuration, this magnetic field traverses the ferromagnetic core and reaches the secondary coil. Depending on the number of turns and the intensity of the magnetic field, an electric voltage is induced in the secondary coil. This voltage can be higher or lower than the initial voltage, depending on the ratio between the number of turns in the primary and secondary windings.

Thus, the transformer is an essential tool in modern electrical energy distribution and utilization systems, serving as a clear example of efficient and safe engineering.

## Conclusions

The conclusion of this work highlights several important aspects of electrical engineering and the process of designing and constructing electrical circuits. Firstly, the paper emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate circuit conditions and adhering to safety standards. Inadequate conditions or failure to follow safety norms can lead to circuit malfunctions or even accidents.

Secondly, it encourages students to become familiar with the process of building an electrical circuit, providing valuable practical learning and a deeper understanding of how electrical circuits operate.

Finally, the work underscores the necessity of adhering to technical standards when constructing transformers, such as the wire thickness for windings and whether to include insulation between layers. These technical details are essential for transformer performance and safety.
